FABLIBS - A Fabulously Fun Word Game App for Parties!

This full stack project is a game based on the popular game of MADLIBS where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, before reading the – often comical or nonsensical – story aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime. 

To play the FABLIBS game, you first need to register. Then you pick a category (Sleepover, Campying, Baby, Bridal). One player fills in the form from parts from the English language (eg. Noun, Verb, Adjective, or Adverb). When completed, the story with the random picked words is revealed, often with hilarious results. If you love the result, you can save it to the gallery page for others to enjoy.
