This full stack project is a game based on the popular game of MADLIBS where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, before reading the – often comical or nonsensical – story aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.

## Front End comments
A logo was created using Photoshop and animated using CSS when the user hovers over the logo to add to the playfulness of the game. Complementary colors were chosen to offset the logo and add to the aesthetics of the site. Additionally, a background for each game category was made to let the user know visually what category of the game they were playing, as well as adding visual interest.
