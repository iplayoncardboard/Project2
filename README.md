FABLIBS - A Fabulously Fun Word Game App for Parties!

This full stack project is a game based on the popular game of MADLIBS where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, before reading the – often comical or nonsensical – story aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime. 

To play the FABLIBS game, you first need to register. Then you pick a category (Sleepover, Campying, Baby, Bridal). One player fills in the form from parts from the English language (eg. Noun, Verb, Adjective, or Adverb). When completed, the story with the random picked words is revealed, often with hilarious results. If you love the result, you can save it to the gallery page for others to enjoy.

## Front End comments
A logo was created using Photoshop and animated using CSS when the user hovers over the logo to add to the playfulness of the game. Complementary colors were chosen to offset the logo and add to the aesthetics of the site. Additionally, a background for each game category was made to let the user know visually what category of the game they were playing, as well as adding visual interest.

## Things to improve upon in future
• More Categories and FabLibs!
• Make possible for user to save favorite FabLibs in a personal or the public Gallery.
• Expand number of FabLibs displayed in Gallery.
• Sort Galleries by favorite Category.
• Add a voting feature that allows user to like their favorite FabLibs in the Gallery.
